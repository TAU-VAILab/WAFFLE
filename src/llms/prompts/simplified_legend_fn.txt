Please rewrite the legend using simple and generic words.

Do:
* Include all legend parts from the list above.
* Keep it simple and short - summarize each row in one or two words
* Keep the original legend keys
* In case the features have distinct names (e.g. Chapel of the Ascension) treat their type only (e.g. a chapel) and disregard any specific name.

Don't:
* Don't invent new information
* Don't specific names (treat their type instead)
* Don't skip any of the legend lines above

Write your answer in English only, translating any non-English terms into English.
