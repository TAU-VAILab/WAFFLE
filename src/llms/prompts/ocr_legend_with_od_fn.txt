The image "{fn}" is a plan of the building "{building_name}" and it contains the following texts (detected by an OCR model).

--- START IMAGE TEXTS ---

{ocr_legend_candidate}

--- END IMAGE TEXTS ---

The above texts may contain, among other things, the content of an image legend (as in a key/table/code for understanding the image).
Can you extract the legend contents from the above texts?
Answer with a bulleted list of the legend contents.
Include only full items and not just keys/labels (for example, '1. nave' can be included, but '1.' or 'nave' alone shouldn't). Disregard text that doesn't seem like it's part of the legend.
Include the original keys/labels and don't invent new ones. If you can't deduce a legend return "I don't know".
